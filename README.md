[![CI](https://github.com/bakhe8/bl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bakhe8/bl/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Starter repository initialized locally. Kick things off by cloning, creating your first feature branch, and adding the stack you want to use.

## Getting started
- Install your preferred toolchain (Node, Python, .NET, etc.).
- Add project files and update `.gitignore` for your stack.
- Run `git status` to verify changes, then commit and push to `main`.

## CI (GitHub Actions)
- A starter workflow lives at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; it checks out the repo and runs language-specific steps when package files exist.
- Extend the workflow with your stack (npm, Python, .NET, etc.) so pushes and PRs run your tests automatically.
- Badge above tracks the latest `main` build.

## Notes
- Remote is expected at `git@github.com:bakhe8/bl.git`.
- Add a LICENSE when you decide on one.
