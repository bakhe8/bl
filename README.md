# bl

Starter repository initialized locally. Kick things off by cloning, creating your first feature branch, and adding the stack you want to use.

## Getting started
- Install your preferred toolchain (Node, Python, .NET, etc.).
- Add project files and update `.gitignore` for your stack.
- Run `git status` to verify changes, then commit and push to `main`.

## Notes
- Remote is expected at `git@github.com:bakhe8/bl.git`.
- Add a LICENSE when you decide on one.
